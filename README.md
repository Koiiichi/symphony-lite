# Symphony-Lite

## Quick Start

### Install
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd symphony-lite
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # use `py -m pip` on Windows
   ```
2. Provide API keys via environment variables or a `.env` file in the project directory:
   ```bash
   export SYMPHONY_BRAIN_API_KEY=... 
   export SYMPHONY_VISION_API_KEY=...
   ```

### Run
* From inside an existing project (the script ensures the bundled virtualenv is ready):
  ```bash
  python symphony.py "Improve the mobile navbar spacing"
  ```
* From any directory with an explicit project path:
  ```bash
  python symphony.py --project ./demo "Create a marketing landing page"
  ```
* Optional ‚Äì add a shell alias once things work:
  ```bash
  alias symphony="python /path/to/symphony.py"                # macOS/Linux shells
  doskey symphony=py C:\path\to\symphony.py $*              # Windows Command Prompt
  function symphony { py C:\path\to\symphony.py $args }     # Windows PowerShell
  ```

Common flags:
* `--open/--no-open` ‚Äì open the detected URL when the run succeeds (default on).
* `--max-passes <int>` ‚Äì limit refinement cycles (default 3).
* `--dry-run` ‚Äì preview routing, stack detection, and safety prompts without running agents.
* `--detailed-log` ‚Äì show expanded trace summaries in the terminal UI.

### What You‚Äôll See
The terminal UI now shows animated progress while the agents work and narrates the hand-off between them:
```
> Ensure UI/UX is up to the mark
‚†ã Vision: Scanning homepage at breakpoints‚Ä¶
üëÅ Vision: Audit complete
  ‚éø Scores ‚Äì alignment: 0.91, spacing: 0.86, contrast: 0.95
  ‚éø Issues: Button tap targets < 44px on mobile
‚á¢ Vision ‚á¢ Brain: Sharing 1 finding for fixes.
üß† Brain: Applied targeted fixes
‚á† Brain ‚á¢ Vision: Updates ready for validation.
```
You‚Äôll also see section, interaction, and accessibility highlights beneath each audit so it‚Äôs clear what the vision agent inspected.

### Testing
Run the full automated suite (unit, integration, CLI checks):
```bash
pytest
```

### Privacy & Safety
Symphony confirms before creating directories or scaffolding new projects, enforces max-pass limits, and never prints raw prompts or API responses in the UI.
